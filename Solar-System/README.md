A simple model of the solar system containing major bodies and moons.

Planetary bodies are all represented by a singular class, and the parent body is determined by where it falls in the transformation coordinate stack.

Basic simulation parameters can be adjusted during runtime:
- W zooms the view in (centred on the sun)
- S zooms the view out (centred on the sun)
- D increases the simulation speed
- A lowers the simulation speed
